        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter or cooking oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced ham or cooked bacon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives) for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper.</li>
            <li>Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined and slightly frothy.</li>
            <li>In a non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of butter or oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion and bell pepper to the skillet. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
            <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add the remaining butter or oil to the empty side.</li>
            <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet, making sure they spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for about 1-2 minutes, until the edges start to set.</li>
            <li>Once the edges are set, use a spatula to gently lift and push the cooked eggs towards the center, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the diced ham or bacon over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the same half.</li>
            <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings, creating a half-moon shape.</li>
            <li>Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the omelette is cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with chopped fresh herbs.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious omelette!</li>
        </ol>
